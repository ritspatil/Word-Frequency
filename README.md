# Word-Frequency

The task is to write a word frequency reporter in JavaScript.  The input is all the words in Hamlet, one word per line, all lower case, randomized, composed only of letters a-z.  Your task is to count how often each word appears, and then report all the words.  Each line in the output is the count of the number of words, followed by one space, followed by the word itself.  The output is sorted on the count descending, but tie broken on the words themselves using dictionary order ascending.
